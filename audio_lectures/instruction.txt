To adjust files for a new podcast episode, follow these steps:

1. Create the folder by duplicating an existing folder
2. Remove any files from the folder that are not needed for this episode. 
In the episode.js file, set title, subtitle, summary, publication date, duration, and url link
Next in episode.js, update filepath of episode.mp3, transcripts.js, and transcripts.txt
Update download sizes of mp3 and txt files. 
Manually update chapters in chapters.js
Upload transcript.txt from Premiere Pro to the transcribe_tool folder. Run node reshape.js in that terminal directory
Move the new transcripts.js into the new episode folder. Confirm speaker names. Let Copilot read the text for any corrections
Move transcripts.txt into the new episode folder for download. 

Run int he terminal, at root folder npm run-script build-episode-json   
That converts the js files needed for the playlist to function into a single json. 

Go to playlist.js and update it with the new json file and other info for the new episode.

Update urls in share.html
