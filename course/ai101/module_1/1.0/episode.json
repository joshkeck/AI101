Like carnival fireworks. Color and motion collide in dizzy spirals. The canvas painted at the high tide of the Futurist movement doesn't invite calm contemplation. It grabs you by the shoulders and hurls you into a scene where roller coaster tracks, electric bulbs and human silhouettes blur into one restless vision of modernity."

AI's landscape can look disorienting, even chaotic if you try to absorb it all in once yet."

You can master our task over the coming weeks is to trace those lines together, turning bewilderment into insight and spectacle, into understanding."
