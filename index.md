## ü§ñ AI101: Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence

I built this site predominantly as a means to share audio lectures for a course I'm developing called Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence, dubbed "AI101" until a real course designator is assigned. I'm using hyflex course design to introduce students to the theory and practice of artificial intelligence. Students will engage with carefully curated audio lectures, hands-on labs, and real-world case studies to build a strong foundation in AI concepts and applications. Key components include:

- **Audio Lecture Series:** Covering AI history, machine learning paradigms, neural networks, deep learning, generative AI, and everything else
- **Interactive Labs:** Guided exercises using Python and open-source tools to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate performance.  
- **Case Studies:** Business-focused scenarios that analyze AI‚Äôs impact on operations, marketing, finance, and public policy.  
- **Generative AI Projects:** Students experiment with large language models and prompt engineering to create content and solutions.

You can learn more about this on the [Course Home Page](audio_lectures/ai101.md). To stream or download all lecture recordings, visit the [Audio Lecture Hub](audio_lectures/audio_lectures.md).
