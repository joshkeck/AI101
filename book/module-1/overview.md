<p align="center"><strong>I'd like you to step back, scroll up, </strong><em><strong>breathe deeply</strong></em><strong>, and take in Joseph Stella’s </strong><em><strong>Battle of Lights, Coney Island</strong></em><strong> (1913-14)</strong></p>

See how the lines explode like carnival fireworks; color and motion collide in dizzy spirals. The canvas—painted at the high tide of the Futurist movement—doesn’t invite calm contemplation. It grabs you by the shoulders and hurls you into a scene where roller-coaster tracks, electric bulbs, and human silhouettes blur into one restless vision of modernity.

For many newcomers, artificial intelligence feels the same way. The moment you saw the syllabus with the course outline you probably thought you were entering into an amusement park lit by a thousand blinking ideas. The terminology is loud, the concepts move fast, and the vantage point keeps shifting. Like Stella’s whirl of Coney Island lights, AI’s landscape can look disorienting, even chaotic, if you try to absorb it all at once.

Yet Futurism’s artists saw purpose in that commotion. They celebrated speed, dynamism, and the promise of machines to reshape human potential. In the same spirit, this course will guide you through the apparent disorder toward the patterns underneath. We’ll pause the carnival ride long enough to examine how algorithms learn, why data holds power, and where the limits—and responsibilities—of AI lie. By the end, the flashing lights won’t feel like noise; they’ll map a coherent skyline of ideas you can navigate with confidence.

So let the canvas set the mood. Embrace the initial vertigo, but remember: every streak of light in Stella’s painting follows a deliberate brushstroke, and every AI breakthrough rests on principles you can master. Our task over the coming weeks is to trace those lines together—turning bewilderment into insight, and spectacle into understanding.

_Okay, okay,_ let's get this out of the way. I didn’t write most of what you just read. I copied it from an AI chatbot using the prompt you’ll see below, and edited only a minor amount.

Prompt to OpenAI's ChatGPT o3 model:

For my course on Fundamentals of AI, the first module is "what is AI?" and I want to open by setting the stage with how confusing it can be to just begin learning about AI. Help me write some opening paragraphs. Be inspired by the Futurism art movement. I'm going to have students see the painting by Joseph Stella, Battle of Lights, Coney Island, 1913–14, oil on canvas. It's a chaotic painting at a time of great technological advancement. I think it's an apt comparison for how many people may be feeling when they approach AI and this course, especially after seeing the course overview and the full breadth of topics we're going to over.

By sharing both the finished text and the exact instructions I gave the model, I want you to peek behind the curtain and watch the machinery work. AI is not magic. It is a _tool_ you can interrogate, direct, and refine.

You’ll probably notice as you progress that _many_ elements of this course were written with generative-AI _tools_. And you would be correct to question the value of that choice—after all, you are investing time, money, and attention to this course. Why come to me when you could do the same thing and just prompt an LLM for “everything about itself” in seconds?

Maybe I can convince you this was a good idea.

Large models can supply _oceans_ of information, but they offer little structure. It's like trying to learn something by scrolling through TikTok. It's fine for a short tidbit, but that doesn't really work for a college-level course. On top of that, _you don't know what you don't know._ What questions should you ask it? What are the key topics? I'm not saying you _shouldn't_ try asking an AI about itself. I'm just saying you're going to spend a lot of time you don't have if you think you can replicate what I've done here for this course. I'm going to ask you to trust me, to let me save you hundreds of hours of time and endless prompting and scrolling.

An instructor's role, in any course, is partly to sift through, sequence, and annotate the instructional content you're confronted with so that it lines up with course outcomes, accreditation standards, and your professional needs. _Normally_, I would find a _textbook_ to do this kind of thing, thus outsourcing much of this work to its authors. _However_, the kinds of textbooks for the approach I want to take with this course simply do not exist yet. The existing textbooks on the market are all written for IT professionals going into AI research and machine learning disciplines. But, I'm a _business_ professor. I have an MBA. I'm _wholly unqualified_ to teach from those textbooks, and that's _not_ what this course is about. (If you're disappointed about that, you may still have time to drop the course and get your money back.)

I think of this course as a _survival guide_. I want you to learn how to grapple with new AI-driven technologies. How to scrutinize AI tools and the _companies_ behind the tools. And most importantly, how to _thrive_ in this brave new world we find ourselves in.

I hope you're successful in that goal. But if I'm being honest, I'm not doing it for you. I'm doing it for myself. I've got a good thirty years of work in front of me too! I want to survive just the same as you do! _I've got mouths to feed!_ If AI takes my job, me and it are going to have some problems.

So to accomplish the goals I have for this course, I found the best option for me was to use the very tools we're going to study, to prompt the LLMs themselves and milk them for all their worth. I think you'll be pleased with the curriculum material I'm presenting to you. It's not my first time doing this for a course. I wouldn't use it if I didn't believe it was of value. Everything you read, whether written by me or by AI, has passed through my review. I am still the instructor; AI is just one of many instruments in my toolkit.

Throughout this course you're also going to have opportunities to read original research if you do prefer engaging with the source material. I will never require you to do so beyond what I've laid out though. I've also strived to weave in videos and interactive content where appropriate to keep this course feeling engaging and alive.

If you're not already in the workforce, then you will be. And you're going to find that your success in your working life could well depend on your ability to direct these systems wisely. But I don't want you to just know _how to use_ AI tools. I want you to know _when and why_ you should use them. And I want you to know when _not_ to use them. This class is not designed to be propaganda for the expanding AI sector of our economy. The AI sector is like any other: there's good, there's bad, and there's ugly. _Really ugly_ in the case of AI. We're going to look at all of it.

Joseph Stella’s _Battle of Lights, Coney Island_ captures the disorientation of rapid technological change. I would venture to say that in the era of AI, this disorienting feeling has even more depth to it than Stella intended. I'm willing to bet that a thought occurred to you, perhaps sub-consciously ... perhaps just as a whisper ...

<p align="center">"<em>did AI make this?"</em></p>

My aim in constructing this course is to turn that confusion and disorientation into clarity. By the end of the term, the seemingly chaotic landscape of artificial intelligence won't feel so insurmountable to grasp. I hope you're as excited as I am. Let's begin.
